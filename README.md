# ancMETA
ancMETA is a Bayesian graph-based framework to perform gene/pathway-specifc meta-analysis by combining the effect size of multiple SNPs within genes, and genes within sub-network/pathways across multiple independent population GWAS to de-convolute the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex
diseases across human populations.
